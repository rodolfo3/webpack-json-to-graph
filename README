Analyze the json file generated by Webpack.
It outputs a graph (using graphviz).

Usage
-----

Generate the json file with:

```
$ webpack --config webpack.config.js --json > output.json
```

Call this with

```
$ python webpack-to-graph.py /path/to/output.json
```

It will generate an `output.gv` file.
To see it in the browser, convert it to svg:

```
$ dot -Tsvg output.gv output.svg
```

Change the `MIN_SIZE_TO_INCLUDE` to include only files below some (total) size.
The label in the graph is the file path, the file size and the file of its requirements.
